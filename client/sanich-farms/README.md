# Sanich Farms Frontend

This is the front-end application for **Sanich Farms**, a modern poultry e-commerce and service platform. The platform enables customers to browse poultry products, book services (like farm consultation), place orders, and manage deliveries, all tailored to the operations of a real Ghanaian poultry farm.

This project is developed by the **Sprint Force** team as part of the **University of Ghana DCIT 208 Software Engineering Project**, using Agile Scrum methodology in collaboration with our client, **Saaka Nicholas**.
